 Context Sensitive Recording mode
 
  It is the default mode of recording which takes full advantage of Quick Test Professional's test
 object model.
  It recognizes objects in the application regardless of their location on the screen.
 
 It records the operations that are preformed in an application by identifying the GUI objects.
 
 Analog recording
 
  records the inputs from keyboard, mouse clicks, the x and y coordinates that are travelled by 
the mouse pointer across the screen.
  It can’t capture GUI windows and objects.
